# Net Zero Carbon Uniform Global Income

This repo is here to put into words the idea that makes me **optimistic about the future** and propels me forward. It's a basic concept, a rough sketch, just a starting point, but I hope with time it'll gain momentum and someday become a reality:

An organization that produces goods and services of net zero carbon emissions, and distributes them uniformly across the global population.

## Technological optimism

One of the main arguments against exponential growth and technological optimism is that the world is finite, that we can't grow forever. Although this is absolutely true, the counter arguments is: how far are we from the physical limits of our planet? At least in energy terms, we're many orders of magnitude away.

* The sun radiates roughly 10^19 W of clean energy (power) onto the surface of the earth.
* Let's assume (roughly) 10^10 people.
* Living comfortably, fossil fuel subsidized, energetically inefficient lives we presently consume (roughly) 10^4 W per person in high income countries.
* Multiply and compare: There 10^19 W available vs 10^14 W needed to live comfortably: **5 orders of magnitude to play with.**

Let's say we only get 10% efficient solar panels and cover just 0.01% of the global surface with solar panels, we can have every human on the planet living comfortable, high income country, energetically inefficient lives.

We can pull this in either direction: capture just 0.00001% of the solar power and have just enough energy for everyone to eat (100W per person - we would presumably just use agriculture for this), or have everyone sitting in Concorde airplanes flying constantly at Mach 2 to then cover ~10% of the surface of the earth with solar panels. In any case, 5 orders of magnitude is plenty.

## Net Zero Carbon

Climate change is probably our generation's biggest challenge. Anything we think for the future has to be sustainable, there really isn't an option.

## Global

Anything short of global is inherently unfair. Why should the place where you are born have any bearing on the safety net you receive?

## Uniform

How can we distribute goods and services *uniformly*? How can we compare two goods or services? I believe that the only possible answer is supply and demand: market pricing. However, there is a caveat, for it to be net zero carbon we need to account all the raw materials and energy that went into making each product and service. 

## ~~Trustless~~ Transparent 

Something this abitious cannot function without trust. How can you otherwise ensure that a product or service was produced with net zero emissions? This doesn't mean we have to blindly trust big institutions. From measuring energy consumption to making sure every benficiary is a unique, real, human being everything should be auditable and cross checked by independent parties.
